# Image Resizer and Converter

This project provides a simple web interface to resize and convert images. Users can upload images, set the desired width and format (JPEG or WebP), and download the converted images as a ZIP package.

Javascript, client-side processing only!

[Live preview](https://textvisualization.app/batch-image-converter/), use as a stand-alone tool or copy the code to integrate code into your workflow! Simply edit the webform / javascript to march image sizes with your specific requirements.


## Features

- Set target image width (820px or 1200px).
- Set target image format (JPEG or WebP).
- Upload multiple images at once.
- Preview uploaded images.
- Remove unnecessary images from the preview.
- Names converted image files consistently, which is good for further use with a CMS.
- Download all converted images as a ZIP package.
- You can extend functionality to upload the ZIP package on server, see how it is done in [Hugo YAML Editor Dashboard](https://github.com/roverbird/superdash).

## Why WebP?

Google highly recommends using the WebP format for images due to its superior compression capabilities, which result in smaller file sizes while maintaining high quality. This is particularly important for web performance and user experience, as smaller images load faster, reducing the overall load time of web pages.

## Who Can Benefit from This Tool?

This tool is especially useful for:

Web Editors and Content Managers: Simplifies the process of converting and resizing images to the preferred WebP format, ensuring optimized images for faster website performance.

Social Media Managers: Helps prepare images in the correct size and format for various social media platforms, enhancing the visual appeal and engagement of posts.

Anyone Working with Web Images: Streamlines the workflow for resizing and converting images, making it easier to handle multiple images efficiently.

By using this tool, you can ensure that your images are web-optimized, contributing to better SEO rankings, faster load times, and an improved user experience on your website or social media channels.

Nough said. Copy and paste this code to easily integrate it with your dashboard or admin panel where image file uploads are required.
